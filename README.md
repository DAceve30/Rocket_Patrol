CMPM 120 Rocket Patrol Modded Game

Name: Luis Diego Acevedo
Title: Retail Wars
Date: 4/23/2022
Hours: 15+ (unsure, but a lot)

Points Breakdown:
60 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 95

(60) Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic
-All assets changed to "retail store" theme

(5) Implement 'FIRE' UI text from the original game

(5) Add your own background music to the Play scene

-Added title screen music (Kevin MacLeod ~ Local Forecast - Elevator)

-Added BGM for Play scene (Ys I&II ~ The Syonin)

(5) Allow the player to control the Rocket after it's fired

(10) Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen

-Works somewhat correctly, but with this included the game crashes once the time limit is reached

(10) Implement parallax scrolling

-The "racks" asset scrolls separately from the scrolling tile background
